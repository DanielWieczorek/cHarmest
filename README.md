# cHarmest
A set of matchers and asserts for C which is inspired by Hamcrest. The name is an anagram of Hamcrest starting with a C :)

The first goal is to create an easy to read framework of matchers, with which the same can be achieved as with the asserts of CUnit.

This framework is written for C11.
